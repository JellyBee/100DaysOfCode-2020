# 100DaysOfCode-2020
The place for my #100DaysOfCode challenge projects/code 

## Why I participate
I already earn my money as freelance frontend developer, so you might think, what the heck does she want to learn? Ooooh, as a developer there is ALWAYS something to learn or get better in. So there a three main things I want to spent my time with: CSS, Vanilla Javascript and the Vue.js Framework. 

## What I want to learn

- Level my CSS skills from advanced to expert (including CSS shapes and animation)
- Improving my Vanilla Javascript skills
- Dive deep into my beloved [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework and master it

## My (special) rules
I try to spent at least 30 minutes a day, but the regular challenge rules say one hour minimum. Maybe there will be some days, when motherhood will take all my time and energy. But I will go on and add the lost days at the end of the challenge. And I hope you guys will forgive me.

In addition I prioritize my goals. The most important ones are skilling Javascript and Vue. The CSS part is more personal fun stuff, so I will concentrate on the other two.

I will push my projects to this GitHub repo. And track my progress here.
I think the CSS stuff I will put on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/miazura).
