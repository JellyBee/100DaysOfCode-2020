# 100DaysOfCode-2020
The place for my #100DaysOfCode challenge projects/code 

## Why I participate
I already earn my money as freelance frontend developer, so you might think, what the heck does she want to learn? Ooooh, as a developer there is ALWAYS something to learn or get better in. So there a three main things I want to spent my time with: CSS, Vanilla Javascript and the Vue.js Framework. 

## What I want to learn

- Level my CSS skills from advanced to expert (including CSS shapes and animation)
- Improving my Vanilla Javascript skills
- Dive deep into my beloved [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework and master it

## My (special) rules
I try to spent at least 30 minutes a day, but the regular challenge rules say one hour minimum. Maybe there will be some days, when motherhood will take all my time and energy. But I will go on and add the lost days at the end of the challenge. And I hope you guys will forgive me.

In addition I prioritize my goals. The most important ones are skilling Javascript and Vue. The CSS part is more personal fun stuff, so I will concentrate on the other two.

I will push my projects to this GitHub repo. And track my progress here.
I think the CSS stuff I will put on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/miazura).

## My progress

**DAY 1: Warm-up.** Couldn't really decide where to start, so I did a little practice thing and did the current challenge on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/miazura/pen/qBExLdw) - HTML multi-buttons with a little css and jQuery.

**DAY 2: Javascript basics.** On the road today. So instead of coding I completed the "Javascript fundamentals" section with 
[Grasshopper App](https://learn.grasshopper.app/). I'm not a beginner, but like to repeat basics from time to time.ðŸ˜… And this app is fun.

**DAY 3: More Javascript basics.** Family party today, but managed to complete the next chapter of Grasshopper App "Fundamentals II" and learned about: 

- String and Array manipulation
- Ternary operator
- Recursion
- Callback functions

**DAY 4: SVG animation basics.** Went on learning with Grasshopper App. I completed the basic SVG animation section using the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) library. Definitely want to dive deeper later.ðŸ¤“

**DAY 5 + 6: More Animations.** More fun with Grasshopper App. Easy to integrate in my daily life with baby. Completed "Animations II" using D3.js and learned about arrow functions.

**DAY 7: Javascript Language Basics.** Started my Udemy JS course today. Learned about: 

- Data Types
- Variable Mutation and Type Coercion
- Operators
- Operator Precedence

.. and solved the first little coding challenge of my Udemy course using what I have learned.
